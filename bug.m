In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with properties declared using `retain` or `copy`.  If you forget to release objects assigned to these properties in `dealloc`, you create a memory leak. This often goes unnoticed until your app experiences performance degradation or crashes due to memory exhaustion. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    // MISSING: [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```

Another similar issue arises with blocks.  If you capture objects within a block and that block outlives those objects, you will encounter dangling pointers and potential crashes. ARC does not eliminate this issue if you're not careful.

```objectivec
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSMutableArray *myArray;

-(void)someMethod {
    __weak MyClass *weakSelf = self; 
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{
      //Use weakSelf to access self, or you may cause retain cycle
      [weakSelf.myArray addObject:@"Object"];
    });
}
```

Failure to handle exceptions properly can lead to unexpected application termination.  Objective-C doesn't automatically handle exceptions like some other languages, so explicit `@try`, `@catch`, `@finally` blocks are essential.
